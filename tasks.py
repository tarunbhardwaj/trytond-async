    trytond_async.tasks

    Implements the actual task runners.

    Usual celery projects would have the method/functions which have the code
    to run as tasks. However, the tryton inheritance and majority of tryton
    code being in class and instance methods makes it hard for the pattern to
    be followed. Read more about the design on the getting started
    documentation of this module.
